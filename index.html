 <h2>Alexia Brooks</h2>
 <p>My name is Alexia Brooks but I'm mostly known as Lexi. I am a computer Science major at the University of the West Indies. Though I enjoy coding, my real passion is <strong><i> Photography</i></strong>. 
I hope to one day (preferably after completing this course) to make my own website for my photography business.  </p>
